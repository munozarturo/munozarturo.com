From a technical perspective, Campus Flavor was nothing special. What made this project good is that it had a mission. Much like every copy of WannaCry was brought into this world with the purpose of collecting and sending your data to the CCP, Campus Flavor was brought into this world to improve my university's merchandise.

Over a three month period two of my friends and I built a website that we would use to host what we had dubbed &ldquo;design competitions.&rdquo; Which would consist of a submission period, during which people could upload their designs, and a voting period during which people could vote for the designs that they liked. All with prize incentives.

We thought that such a system would allow us to deterministically select the designs that were the most popular with our school&lsquo;s student body. Designs that we could then sell to said student body and in some way, contribute to an improved campus culture.

Of course our plans were thwarted by none other than the School&lsquo;s media team, which&mdash;shortly after finding out what we we&lsquo;re trying to do&mdash;sent us a cease and desist letter and demanded that we stop our competition immediately. Of course, we complied and that was that.

Even though the competition was ended early we still got sixty submissions which gave us some absolute jewels, like this one
