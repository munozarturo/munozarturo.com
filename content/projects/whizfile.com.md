[whizfile.com](https://www.whizfile.com) is the first &ldquo;proper&rdquo; website that I made. It is the first time I used react, the first time I used a full stack framework, the first time I used TypeScript, and the first time I used external services like S3. What `whizfile` was inspired by was a popular file transfer service, [wetransfer.com](https://wetransfer.com/). I used this service a lot and eventually decided attempt to make something similar. Like a boy fascinated by planes making a paper aircraft I set out to make a funtional copy of this website.

And a functional copy I made. I even added features that I thought a file transfer service should have like being able to set the maximum number of downloads or views a transfer can receive, being able to decide when a transfer expires down to the minute, and allowing the receiver to delete a transfer if the sender deems it appropriate. It wasn't bloated, and it remained simple and useful ever since its inception.

Even a year later, whizfile perseveres and I...am proud. It doesn't have a bad rep, either. It saw a lot of use with some of my not so academically *inclined* friends who liked sharing class assignments with each other&mdash;the privacy features really helped this use case&mdash;and, more importantly, it still stands strong. Today, you can go to whizfile, upload a file and get a transfer link. Send that transfer link to someone. Have said person download your transfer, and have it all work.

This was a project that started as a simple exploration into the jugnle that is web developed and led to me dedicating my foreseeable life to exploration. Starting the NextJS project that became whizfile made me feel like *Marco Polo* slashing his first vine.

I will always look back at whizfile and think about it as &ldquo;the one&rdquo; that started it all.
